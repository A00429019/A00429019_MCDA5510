Hi Dan,

I am a student in your class. I am a B.Tech Computer Science student and have an year of internship and an year of employment experience in an MNC as a Software Engineer. I do not have a good hand in Java though, however, I have started learning it now.
I am articulate in Python. I learned C, C++ and .NET in my college.
I have worked on these projects:
    Sentiment Analysis
    Web Crawler
Looking forward to learn under your supervision.

Thank You
